-   Create a directed graph-like structure to store game relationships between users.
    There is a graph for every TimeControl (unique by id -- one for "blitz", one for
    "classical", ...).

    Such a graph stores weighted directed edges (A, B) where A and B are user names.
    Each edge is weighted with three integral weights; each weight encodes
    a number of games of A against B in which A plays as white (and B as black).
    There are three such weights: the number of games won by A, the number of draws,
    and the number of games won by B.

    The graph is updated after every game and is always loaded in memory. Due to
    safety concerns, the graph should always be stored in disk after every update.

-   Add a UserAction that allows a user to create games only for certain types of
    users.
    CREATE_GAME // this already exists

        // new UserAction
        CREATE_GAME_STUDENT
        CREATE_GAME_TEACHER
        CREATE_GAME_ADMIN
        CREATE_GAME_MEMBER

-   Add a function in the client to rebuild all the graphs in the server.
